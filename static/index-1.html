<h1 id="static">STATIC</h1>
<p><strong>This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.</strong></p>
<p>This directory contains your static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to <code>/</code>.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.</p>
<p>Example: <code>/static/robots.txt</code> is mapped as <code>/robots.txt</code>.</p>
<p>More information about the usage of this directory in <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static">the documentation</a>.</p>
